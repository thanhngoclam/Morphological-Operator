# Morphological Operator
### Problem: 
Implement morphological operators manually and compare with built-in functions from OpenCV library.

### Included folder and files:
  - Folder **report**:
    * **report.pdf**: explains some functions applied for both binary and grayscale image (dilation, erosion, opening, closing),  function boundary extraction for binary image and others for grayscale image (morphological gradient, top-hat and smoothing).
    * **report(cont).pdf**: explains two additional function for grayscale image (black-hat and textual segmentation).
    * **report.tex**: source LaTex for _report.pdf_.
    * **reprot(cont).tex**: source LaTex for _report(cont).pdf_.
  - **source.ipynb**: source code for implementation of morphological operators.
  - Folder **image**: images for testing purpose.
